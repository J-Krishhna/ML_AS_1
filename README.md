## SCENARIO 1: Analysis of E-commerce Sales Data
In order to comprehend product-level sales behaviour, spot trends, and look for missing data, this project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce dataset.

### Goals
The e-commerce dataset should be loaded and examined. Its structure and summary statistics should be examined.
Find missing values in various columns. Use bar and line charts to visualise product sales.

### Tools & Libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, and Python

### Public Kaggle Dataset: E-commerce Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)

### Important Findings: The distribution of sales varies greatly among products.
Higher sales volumes are a result of a small number of products.
There are missing values, which need to be addressed before further analysis.

Additional sales forecasting and business decision-making are based on this analysis.


## SCENARIO 2: Patient Health Dataset Analysis
This project analyzes a patient health dataset to identify missing medical metrics and understand the distribution of key health attributes related to diabetes using exploratory data analysis techniques.

### Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Pima Indians Diabetes Database
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

### Objectives
Load and inspect the dataset using Pandas
Detect missing or invalid health metrics
Visualize glucose levels and age distribution using histograms and boxplots
Identify basic patterns in health indicators

### Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

### Summary
The analysis highlights data quality issues, variations in glucose levels, and age-related patterns that are useful for further healthcare analysis and predictive modeling.


## Scenario 3: Housing Price Data Analysis

This project analyzes a housing dataset to identify missing features and examine relationships between house attributes and prices using exploratory data analysis.

### Dataset
- **Kaggle:** Housing Price Prediction  
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction

### Objectives
- Inspect dataset structure and missing values  
- Visualize relationships between numerical features using scatter plots and heatmaps  
- Interpret trends for price prediction  

### Key Insights
- House price increases strongly with larger area  
- Bathrooms and bedrooms show moderate positive correlation with price  
- Some features contain missing values that require preprocessing  
- Correlation analysis highlights important predictors for pricing models
- 

## Scenario 3: Customer Personality Analysis
This project analyzes customer demographic and spending data to understand customer behavior, detect missing information, and explore patterns useful for segmentation and decision-making.

### Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Customer Personality Analysis  
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

### Objectives
- Import the dataset into Pandas  
- Examine data structure, column types, and missing values  
- Visualize age distribution using bar plots  
- Analyze income and spending patterns using box plots  

### Key Insights
- Income contains missing values and requires data cleaning  
- Most customers belong to middle-age groups  
- Customer spending varies widely, with notable high-spending outliers  
- Income and spending patterns are useful for customer segmentation and targeting
